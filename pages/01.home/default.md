#The Backstory#
I've been a Unix SysAdmin since 1982. Life was simple back then. If you did a ps, you'd see init, a few gettys, cron, not much more. It was a small, tight-knit family. We knew everybody. 

The other day while teaching an Intro to Linux class, I did a ps. There were over 200 processes listed. I looked through them and didn't see many familiar old faces. In fact, I figured I knew only about half of what was running. This was unacceptable. 

Hence the idea for this site. I just installed a default version of Ununtu 16.04, and did a ps. Below you'll see the results of that and I'll attempt to annotate each and every process present. Wish me luck.
